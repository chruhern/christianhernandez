                <p>
                    ECE-118 is a ten-week course at UC Santa Cruz that culminates with solving an open-ended mechatronics 
                    problem in a three-person team. This year, we were tasked with designing an autonomous robot that can robustly navigate an 
                    obstacle-filled playing field, locating and trapping rolling 25mm chrome balls, storing them
                    within our robot in order to push them onto our opponents field all within a two-minute round. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To effectively complete the challenge, our team split into three sub-teams: mechanical, electrical, and software. I led the electrical
                    sub-team, designing the fourth-order butterworth bandpass filter required to detect a 2KHz signal, the robots power distribution board, and developed
                    the wiring harness for our actuators and sensors. Our final design consisted of a square chassis fitted with a motorized vaccuum-style intake
                    for collection and disposal, a retractable servo-arm to open the opponents door, and micro-switches for bump/obstacle detection. Inside the PIC32,
                    our software lead designed a hierarchical state machine programmed with event detection capabilities to handle field-navigation. We succesfully 
                    completed the challenge and finished second in competition.
