I am a first-generation university graduate, recently completing my B.S.E in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a focus on Electronics and Mechatronic Systems.

I thrive in fast-paced environments, and I have helped deliver a range of technical results during my time at UCSC - designing a power distribution board for an autonomous LiDAR sensing device, developing the hardware system for an autonomous field-navigating robot, and simulating LQR and PID control systems using Matlab, C, and Simulink.

I am currently seeking an electrical engineering role in the robotics industry with the goal of designing autonomous systems and electronics that uplift and benefit our communities.
