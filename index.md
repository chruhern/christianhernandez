Hi! I'm Christian, and I recently earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UC Santa Cruz this past Spring. I focused the majority of my work in analog circuitry, embedded systems, and mechatronics, giving me a broad-range of experience in both software and hardware design. I set up this website with the idea of showcasing my work and personal interests. The HTML/CSS code is found inside my GitHub if interested. 

 I am currently searching for a full-time role that fits my skill-set and prioritizes collaboration/mentorship. If you would like to discuss my work further, please reach out.
